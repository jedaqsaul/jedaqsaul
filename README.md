- Database design, ORM modelling, and migration workflows.
- Building full-stack features: backend, frontend, and integrations.
- Automated testing, CI pipelines, and code quality practices.
- Containerization and simple, repeatable deployments.

# How I work

- Break complex problems into small, testable units and iterate quickly.
- Prefer explicit contracts (well documented APIs and data models).
- Keep documentation concise and up to date.
- Choose maintainability and clarity over premature optimization.
